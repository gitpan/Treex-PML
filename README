Treex-PML

This module implements a basic API for working with Prague Markup
Language (PML).

Prague Marup Language (PML) is an XML-based, universally applicable
data format based on abstract data types intended primarily for
interchange of linguistic annotations. It is completely independent of
a particular annotation schema. It can capture simple linear
annotations as well as annotations with one or more richly structured
interconnected annotation layers, dependency or constituency trees. A
concrete PML-based format for a specific annotation is defined by
describing the data layout and XML vocabulary in a special file called
PML Schema and referring to this schema file from individual data
files (instances). The schema can be used to validate the
instances. It is also used by applications to ``understand'' the
structure of the data and to choose optimal in-memory
representation. The generic nature of PML makes it very easy to
convert data from other formats to PML without loss of information.

PML and was developed at the Institute of Formal and Applied
Linguistics of the Charles University in Prague. It was first used in
the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0 and several other treebanks
since. Conversion tools for various existing treebank formats are
available, too.

Note: this library was originally developed for the TrEd framework
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/tred) and evolved gradually from an
older library called Fslib implementing a different data format.
